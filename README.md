# Payroll-System

## Abstract
This project, developed as part of the Industrial Computing Design Project 3 subject in my bachelor's degree in computer engineering, aims to automate employee attendance tracking and payroll processing. By incorporating biometric data such as fingerprints, the system ensures accurate employee identification, reduces fraudulent activities, and improves data integrity. This solution minimizes manual data entry, enhances payroll accuracy, and boosts overall productivity, leading to significant cost savings.

## Introduction to the Problem
Manual employee attendance tracking and payroll processing can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and susceptible to fraud. Traditional methods often involve substantial manual data entry and can be vulnerable to inaccuracies, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs.

## Why You Want to Fix It
Automating attendance tracking and payroll processing improves accuracy, security, and efficiency. By using biometric data for employee identification, the system addresses issues related to fraud and manual errors, ensuring reliable attendance records and precise payroll calculations. This leads to cost savings and streamlined operations.

## How Youâ€™re Going to Fix It
The solution involves developing a Payroll System that automates attendance tracking and payroll processing using biometric technology. The system includes functionalities for employee enrollment, biometric data collection, attendance tracking, payroll processing, and detailed reporting. Key components include a secure database, tailored payroll software, and reliable attendance recording mechanisms.
